<h1>Trusted authentication</h1>

<p>
You've reached the root of the ThoughtSpot trusted authentication example.
</p>
<p>
    To authentication with a user, call
<span class="mono">https://&lt;auth-host&gt;/token/&lt;username&gt;</span> where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <span class="mono">username</span> is the name of the user to get.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Current this service will always return a token for the given user assuming they exist and the secret key is properly set in the server environment.
